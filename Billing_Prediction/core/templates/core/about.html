        <p class="about-intro">
            BillingAI is an intelligent healthcare billing prediction system
            that leverages machine learning to estimate patient billing costs
            accurately and efficiently.

            <h3>Project Objective</h3>
            <p>
                To help hospitals and healthcare providers estimate
                patient billing amounts in advance using data-driven insights.

            <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                A regression-based ML model trained on healthcare data
                with strong performance (high R² score) predicts billing costs
                based on patient and treatment attributes.
